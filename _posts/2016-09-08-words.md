**Mass car owenship** in many cities has become a concern to many people. How should we change the situation if you think it leads to **undersirable consequence**?


Mass car ownership clearly has a number of undersirable consequences for people's health and fitness **as well as** for the environment and community life generally. Nevertheless, owning a car is still seen as **a desirable option** to many. Although this trend might **seem irreversible** so far, there is much that can be done to discourage unnecessary car use.

One possible **approach** is to make cars expensive to own and use, for example, by **taxing** them at the point of purchase or annually through a road tax. Certain types of car use, for instance short journeys within already congested cities, can also be discouraged through road pricing strategies. However, these **punitive measure alone** are unlikely to have a major impact unless **alternative** means of trasport are available.

A more effective method that governments could take in busy cities is to encourage the use of public transport. This means that transport options have to be plentiful, convenient and reliable and people need to be able to **afford them**. Beside, governments should **run campaigns** to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars.

To sum up, the trend towards rising car ownership and use need to be changed. People should be encouraged to use other means of transport and investment in practical alternatives is what is needed above all.

A: Well, I've been **having trouble making rent**. Would you mind lending me 600$?  
B: Six hundred dollars? **I wish I could help, but** I really don't have that kind of money.  
A: I understand that's a lot to ask. But do you think you could spare, **say**, 300$?  
B: Yeah, I can **help with** that.
