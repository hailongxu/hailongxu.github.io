pawn rook/castle knight bishop queen king  
red/black Palace  

* Rooks (R) (or chariorts) : moves as an orthodox Rook.  
* Knight (N) (or horses) : moves one point orthogonally followed by one point outward-diagonally. It may not leap over occupiedpoints.  
* elephants (M) (or bishops or ministers) : moves exactly two points diagonally. It may not leap over occupied points. Also, Elephants are confined to their home side of the river. Due to these limitations, the Elephant can see only server points of the board.  
* mandarins (G) (or advisors or assistants or guards) : The mandarin (or Guard) moves point diagonally. It may never leave the palace.  
* king (K) (or generals) : The king moves as orthodox king, but cannot move diagonally. It may never leave the palace.  
The two kings cannot face each other on an open file. For example, a red king on e1 and a black king on e9, with no piece on the e-file between them, is an illegal position. If either king sits exposed on an open file, the other king may not move to occpy that file.  
* Cannons (Pao) : the cannon move differently when moves to capture than when moves passively
  1. the cannon movespassively as an othodox rook
  1. The Cannnon moves to capture as an orthodox rook which is required to hop over a single screen. In other words, Cannons capture by hoping over as second piece in order to capture a third piece. For example, a Canon on a1 can take a f1 when exactly one of the points b1,c1,d1,or e1 is occupied bya a piece of either color. Cannons only capture when hoping and only hop when, capturing. They man never hop over more thant on piece in a given more.
* Pawns (P) (or soldiers) ： Unlike orthodox Pawns, the Xiangqi pawn's posssive move and capure move are always the same.　Astarting Pawn moves openint straight-froward. A pawn crossing river promotes, keeping its old move and gaining a new move -- a one-point step to either horizontal. Pawns do not promote on the last rank, where they can move onlyu left or right. 

other rules:

1. Red moves first.
1. The game is won by checkmating or stalemating the opponent King.
1. Perpetual check is forbidden. You cannot cehck your opponent more than three times in a row with the same piece and same board positions.
1. You cannot force an enemy piece to move to and from the same two points, indefinitely, in order to avoid capture. If you move a Rook to e5, threatening a Cannon on e6, and your opponent's only viable move is Cannon to f6, then you cannot force that Cannon to and from e6 and f6 by moving your Rook to and form e5 and f5, indefinitely. The purpose of this rule (and the above rule) is to avoid perpetual-check draws. Some of these situations are complicated, but the person who is forcing the perpetual move must ususally break it off.
1. The game is a draw when neither side can force a checkmate or a stalemate.

**Mass car owenship** in many cities has become a concern to many people. How should we change the situation if you think it leads to **undersirable consequence**?


Mass car ownership clearly has a number of undersirable consequences for people's health and fitness **as well as** for the environment and community life generally. Nevertheless, owning a car is still seen as **a desirable option** to many. Although this trend might **seem irreversible** so far, there is much that can be done to discourage unnecessary car use.

One possible **approach** is to make cars expensive to own and use, for example, by **taxing** them at the point of purchase or annually through a road tax. Certain types of car use, for instance short journeys within already congested cities, can also be discouraged through road pricing strategies. However, these **punitive measure alone** are unlikely to have a major impact unless **alternative** means of trasport are available.

A more effective method that governments could take in busy cities is to encourage the use of public transport. This means that transport options have to be plentiful, convenient and reliable and people need to be able to **afford them**. Beside, governments should **run campaigns** to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars.

To sum up, the trend towards rising car ownership and use need to be changed. People should be encouraged to use other means of transport and investment in practical alternatives is what is needed above all.
