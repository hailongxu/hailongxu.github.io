# magic
* :set magic
* :set nomagic
* :h magic " help for magic
* magic (\m)：except $ . * ^ all others need backslash before them
* nomagic (\M)：except $ ^ all others need backslash before them
* this seting can be use in regex by inserting \m \M to front. Regex behind \m will be regarded as **magic** mode, regex behind \M as nomagic mode, ignoring the set setting of magic
* `/\m.*`          # find any string
* `/\M.*`          # find string `.*` (asterisk following dot)
* \v 和 \V
* \v (namely very magic): no need to add backslash to any meta char
* \V (namely very nomagic): backslahs must be added front any meta char
* /\v(a.c){3}$   # find abcaccadc at the end of line
* /\m(a.c){3}$   # find (abc){3} at the end of line
* /\M(a.c){3}$   # find (a.c){3} at the end of line
* /\V(a.c){3}$   # find (a.c){3}$ at any position
* magic is the default seting, vim also recommend us to use magic mode, but you can use \v\m\M\V under special demands.
* refer to [regex](http://dpinglee.blog.163.com/blog/static/144097753201212111846389/)

\@= | (?=exp | to match before the start of exp. 匹配exp前面的位置, 顺序环视
\@! | (?!exp | to match at the end of NOT exp. 匹配后面跟的不是exp的位置, 顺序否定环视
\@<= | (?<=exp | to match from the end of exp. 匹配exp后面的位置, 逆序环视
\@<! | (?<!exp | to match before the start of NOT exp. 匹配前面不是exp的位置, 逆序否定环视
\@> | (?>exp | 固化分组
\%(atom\) | (?:exp | 非捕获型括号
> The grammer exists a little difference between vim and perl, vim中的环视和固化分组的模式的位置与perl不同。  
例如，查找紧跟在 foo 之后的 bar，perl将模式写在环视的括号内，而vim将模式写在环视的元字符之前。  
Example of Perl:  /(?<=foo)bar/
Example of vim:  /\(foo\)\@<=bar
