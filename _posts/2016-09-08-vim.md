# magic
* :set magic
* :set nomagic
* :h magic " help for magic
* magic (\m)Ôºöexcept $ . * ^ all others need backslash before them
* nomagic (\M)Ôºöexcept $ ^ all others need backslash before them
* this seting can be use in regex by inserting \m \M to front. Regex behind \m will be regarded as **magic** mode, regex behind \M as nomagic mode, ignoring the set setting of magic
* `/\m.*`          # find any string
* `/\M.*`          # find string `.*` (asterisk following dot)
* \v Âíå \V
* \v (namely very magic): no need to add backslash to any meta char
* \V (namely very nomagic): backslahs must be added front any meta char
* /\v(a.c){3}$   # find abcaccadc at the end of line
* /\m(a.c){3}$   # find (abc){3} at the end of line
* /\M(a.c){3}$   # find (a.c){3} at the end of line
* /\V(a.c){3}$   # find (a.c){3}$ at any position
* magic is the default seting, vim also recommend us to use magic mode, but you can use \v\m\M\V under special demands.
* refer to [regex](http://dpinglee.blog.163.com/blog/static/144097753201212111846389/)
