# theme model
[black doc](http://karloespiritu.com/blackdoc/styles/)
[multi-column]( http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/feeling-responsive/)

## add table ability
\_config.yml, the following lines added to it  
> markdown: redcarpet  
redcarpet:  
	extensions: ["tables"] 

`$ sudo apt install redcarpet `

## config domain
type:CNAME host:www value:hailongxu.github.io

But sometimes the content of github and the new dns are different. How a embarassing thing!

## access the github by ssh
Using ssh protocol is saving the time of inputing name & password when you push to another git server.  
You will be identified by the github server by copy your PublicKey to github, and the RSA file is put at ~/.ssh, generated by ssh-keygen -t rsa -C xxx@mail.com if no file there.
