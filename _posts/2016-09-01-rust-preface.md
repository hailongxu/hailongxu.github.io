# Why do we study rust, a new language
She has some futures totally different from ever system language

* zero cost abstraction
* move semantics
* guaranted memory safety
* thread without data races
* trait based generics
* pattern matching
* type inference
* minimal runtime lib
* efficient C binding

offical definition: Rust is a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
