# distribution system
## reason
* network lantency/delay : perference and timeout
* network error/fault/fail/failure: package loss, out of order/sequence, fluctuation/jitter

## CAP
* Consistency: [strong] consistence, transaction assurance, ACID
* Availiability: [high] available, redundance in case of single point of failure
* Partition tolerance: [high] expansibility/extensibility/scalability/scable

## consistence model
* strong consistency
* weak consistency
* eventual consistency

## variation/variant/variety/morphant
> Allophone

* causal consistency (因果一致性)
* read-your-wirtes consistency (读你所写一致性)
* session consistency (会话一致性)
* monotonic read consistency (单调一致性)

# distribution application
* consistent hasing [with virtual node]
* vector clock : http://coolshell.cn/articles/10910.html
* quorum W+R>N [with vector clock]: **drawer principle**(抽屉原理)，another way for consistence.  
    NWR model generally cause conflit between dirty data and version, usually draw into algo "vector clock" to solve it.   
    More info see : [NWR](http://coolshell.cn/articles/10910.html)
* merkle tree [with anti-entropy]: 数据复制
* MVCC: copy on write and snapshot
* 2/3PC: distribution transaction
* paxos: strong consistence protocol
* symmetry and decentralization: decentralization is the extension of symmetry, avoiding single master, convient for cluster scale out
* map reduce: try put the data to the machine running the tasks
* gossip: node management
* lease mechanism: In given time, promise from leased node: the role will not change during valid period

# protocol
for example:

```bash
set who me
*3\r\n$3\r\nset\r\n$3\r\nwho\r\n\$2\r\nme\r\n
```
