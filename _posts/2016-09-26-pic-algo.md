# Perceptual hash algorithm
> proposed by: Neal Krawetz
fingerprint

1. downsize to 8x8 size
1. reduce the color deep to 64 grey color
1. average : calculate the average value of 64 pixels' grey color
1. compare : 0 if color > average or 1
1. hash : convert to vector from last result, all the pic's sequence should be same, get the statistics of same bit, the more the more similar, like Hamming distance

In reality, it is probable to adopt pHash and SITF algo, which can diagnoise/recognise the deform of picture, as long as the extent of deform is less than 25%.

# gossip
anti-entropy : if data is not consistent start synchronize   
rumor mongering : synchronize at regular time  

* push gossip : A send (key,value,version) to B, B update what is newer in A
* pull gossip : A send (key,version) to B, B send what (key,value,version) is newer than sended A
* push-pull gossip : plus one step compared to pull. A send newer to B, B update local

### reconciliation 
* pricise reconciliation
each data has a version  
* scuttlebutt reconciliation
maintain a version for all data
