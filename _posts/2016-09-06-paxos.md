# The Consensus Algorithm
The following is Paxos theorems presented by Leslie Lamport:  
如下是Paxos的定理由Leslie Lamport给出： 

## The requirement of consistence:
- Only a value that has been proposed may be chosen,
- Only a single value is chosen, and
- A process never learns that a value has been chosen unless it actually has been.

## 一致性要求：
- 被提出的提案才有可能被选中
- 一次实例，只能有一个提案被选中
- 只有被选中的提案才能被学习

## algorithm process
P1. An acceptor must accept the first proposal that it receives.  
P1. 接受者必须接受第一次提案  

P2. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal that is chosen has value v.  
P2. 如果一个提案(value=v)被选中，那么被选中的更高编号的提案其value=v  

P2a. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal accepted by any acceptor has value v.  
P2a. 如果value=v的提案被选中，那么任一更高编号的提案被任一接受者接受的其值也是v  

P2b. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal issued by any proposer has value v.  
P2b. 如果value=v的提案被选中，那么由任一提议者提出的每一个更高编号的提议其值也是v  

P2c. For any v and n, if a proposal with value v and number n is issued, then there is a set S consisting of a majority of acceptors such that either (a) no acceptor in S has accepted any proposal numbered less than n, or (b) v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among all proposals numbered less than n accepted by the acceptors in S.  
P2c. 对任一(v,n)，如果一个提议(value=v,number=n)被发布，那么存在一个集合S（包含大多数接收者），这些接收者或者(a)在集合S中没有接收者接受比编号n小的提议，或者(b)v是最高编号提议的value，此编号在集合S中的所有接收者接受的提议的编号中小于n  

P1a. An acceptor can accept a proposal numbered n iff it has not responded to a prepare request having a number greater than n.  
P1a. 一个接收者能接受一个提议(number=n)，当且仅当它没有响应过比n大的prepare请求  

## Algorithm Steps

### Phrase 1.   
(a) A proposer selects a proposal number n and sends a prepare request with number n to a majority of acceptors.   
(b) If an acceptor receives a prepare request with number n greater than that of any prepare request to which it has already responded, then it responds to the request with a promise not to accept any more proposals numbered less than n and with the highest-numbered proposal (if any) that it has accepted.

### 阶段一  
(a) 一个提议者选择一个提议编号n，发送一个prepare请求(number=n)给大多数接收者  
(b) 如果一个接收者收到一个请求，其编号n大于所有的它已响应的prepare请求的编号，那么，它就响应这个请求，并承诺不在接收任何其编号小于n的prepare请求，并且是已接收提议的最高编号提议  

###  Phrase 2.   
(a) If the proposer receives a response to its prepare requests (numbered n) from a majority of acceptors, then it sends an accept request to each of those acceptors for a proposal numbered n with a value v, where v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among the responses, or is any value if the responses reported no proposals.   
(b) If an acceptor receives an accept request for a proposal numbered n, it accepts the proposal unless it has already responded to a prepare request having a number greater than n.   

###  阶段二  
(a) 如果提议者收到大多数接收者对perpare请求的响应(number=n)，那么它就发送accept请求(number=n,value=v)给一个大多数接收者，其中，v是在所有相应中最高编号请求值，或者是任意值如果没有提议去响应  
(b) 如果接收者收到对提议(number=n)的accept请求，它接受这个提议除非它已经响应了perpare请求(number>n)。
