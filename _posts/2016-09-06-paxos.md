# The Consensus Algorithm
The following is Paxos theorems presented by Leslie Lamport:  
如下是Paxos的定理由Leslie Lamport给出： 

## The requirement of consistence:
- Only a value that has been proposed may be chosen,
- Only a single value is chosen, and
- A process never learns that a value has been chosen unless it actually has been.

## 一致性要求：
- 被提出的提案才有可能被选中
- 一次实例，只能有一个提案被选中
- 只有被选中的提案才能被学习

## algorithm process
P1. An acceptor must accept the first proposal that it receives.  
P1. 接受者必须接受第一次提案  

P2. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal that is chosen has value v.  
P2. 如果一个提案(value=v)被选中，那么被选中的更高编号的提案其value=v  

P2a. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal accepted by any acceptor has value v.  
P2a. 如果value=v的提案被选中，那么任一更高编号的提案被任一接受者接受的其值也是v  

P2b. If a proposal with value v is chosen, then every higher-numbered proposal issued by any proposer has value v.  
P2b. 如果value=v的提案被选中，那么由任一提议者提出的每一个更高编号的提议其值也是v  

P2c. For any v and n, if a proposal with value v and number n is issued, then there is a set S consisting of a majority of acceptors such that either (a) no acceptor in S has accepted any proposal numbered less than n, or (b) v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among all proposals numbered less than n accepted by the acceptors in S.  
P2c. 对任一(v,n)，如果一个提议(value=v,number=n)被发布，那么存在一个集合S（包含大多数接收者），这些接收者或者(a)在集合S中没有接收者接受比编号n小的提议，或者(b)v是最高编号提议的value，此编号在集合S中的所有接收者接受的提议的编号中小于n  

P1a. An acceptor can accept a proposal numbered n iff it has not responded to a prepare request having a number greater than n.  
P1a. 一个接收者能接受一个提议(number=n)，当且仅当它不能响应比n大的prepare请求
